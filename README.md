I am excited to share the successful completion of my fourth and final internship task at **Prodigy** 🚀. For this project, I developed a **QR Code Scanner App** that enables users to scan QR codes using their device's camera and perform actions based on the scanned information. This task has been instrumental in showcasing my skills as an Android Developer.

**Key Technologies:**

- **Java** ☕: Employed to build the core functionality of the QR code scanner and handle data processing.
- **XML** 📜: Utilised to design an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring a smooth experience for users.
- **Android Studio** 🛠️: The primary IDE for development, debugging, and testing the application.

**Features Implemented:**

- **QR Code Scanning** 📷: Enables users to scan QR codes in real-time using their device's camera.
- **Information Extraction** 📝: Displays the encoded information from the QR code directly on the screen.
- **Link and Action Handling** 🔗: Offers options to open links or execute specific actions based on the scanned content.

**Objective:**

This project aimed to create a robust QR code scanning application that not only decodes and displays information but also provides practical options for user interaction. It highlights my ability to leverage Android development tools to deliver a functional and engaging app.
